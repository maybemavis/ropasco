Ropasco is a turn-based combat game played with the logic of Rock, Paper, Scissors!
Each of these items has an offensive ability with different twists- rock deals a significant amount of blunt damage, but with a cool down period. Paper deals a low amount of damage with a chance for lifesteal. Scissors deal a moderate amount of damage with a chance for bleed damage! And of course, the traditional "paper beats rock" etc logic applies, with each attack dealing extra damage (or having a higher success rate?) on their respective vulnerable targets (i.e., paper attack on a rock enemy has a higher chance of increased lifesteal). Battle your way through the dungeon to free yourself of the curse and become the ultimate master wizard of what were once the most powerful spells known to humankind!
